["Click here to launch the app"](https://kathdoza.github.io/project_1/)


This application uses JS/jQuery and multiple API interactions to:
* query a recipe based on a given ingreditent
* display nutritional values for that recipe, based on its ingredients
* query a similar food product, available for purchase at a nearby restaurant
* display nutritional values for that product for comparison

This app does currently use testing plans for all APIs involved, so keys used do have a call limit.

**TECHNOLOGIES USED:**

    HTML

    CSS

    Javascript

    jQUERY

    Firebase

    Bootstrap
    
    API (Food2Fork, Nutritionix, ShareThis)
