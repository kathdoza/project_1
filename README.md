#### A nutrition app for deciding how to eat!


This application uses JS/jQuery and multiple API interactions to:
* query a recipe based on a given ingreditent
* display nutritional values for that recipe, based on its ingredients
* query a similar food product, available for purchase at a nearby restaurant
* display nutritional values for that product for comparison

This app does currently use testing plans for all APIs involved, so keys used do have a call limit.
